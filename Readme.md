 Understanding the System Workflow and Error Handling

Introduction:
This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the workflow and error handling mechanisms implemented in the system. The system is designed to manage customers' internet subscriptions, including registration, authentication, subscription management. It integrates with RouterOS for bandwidth management.

1. Authentication and Authorization:

Users are signed up for an account using the signup view.
Users cannot login to the system.
Authentication is enforced using the @login_required decorator, ensuring that only authenticated staff can access certain views.

2. Customer Management:

Customers can be viewed, updated, and deleted by authenticated staff members.
The CustomerSignupForm is used for customer registration, allowing staff to specify customer details such as name, email, phone, router IP address, and bandwidth.
The Customer model stores customer information, including subscription status and last payment date.

3. RouterOS Integration:

The system interacts with RouterOS via the routeros_api library to manage bandwidth for customers.
Error handling is implemented for cases where there are issues connecting to RouterOS. If an error occurs, it's logged, and an appropriate message is displayed to the user.


5. Staff Management:

Staff members can be registered and managed by admins.
Different permissions can be assigned to staff members using the StaffSignupForm.

6. Error Handling:
Errors related to RouterOS connectivity issues are caught and logged using the logger.error function and messages module to provide the error details to the user.
